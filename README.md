# On-Browser-Character-Recognizer

This is an on browser Character Recognizer which uses Tensorflow JS to run locally on your browser. 

This is an ultra light weight character recognizer which can be run from any screen, so the only dependency being having acces to a browser.

Just draw any character ( A-Z, a-z, 0-9 ) on the black area using a mouse/touch input and press Predict, and the neural network running on your browser will predict and show top 5 prediction it makes using your input in a graph.
